# File-System-Simulation
This project is a software simulation of a file system by implementing user interface similar to a command prompt. Through the implemnetation of eight unique commands, users are able to interact with the file system by accessing and modifying the files it contains. This program can be accessed through command prompt (Windows) or terminal (iOS).

Throughout the process, I utilized object-oriented design principles and patterns to eliminate redundant code and increase code flexibility. This was made possible by using interface inheritance, abstract factory design pattern, prototype pattern, composite pattern, command pattern, and more to create this file simulation.

Commands: 
<br>Cat: used for either appending text to end of file or overwriting text
<br>ce: creates a file and then immediately edits it with the command
<br>cp: copies a file that exists in the file system and adds it to the file system with a different name
<br>ds: displays a file in the filesystem
<br>ls: lists out all the files currently in the file system
<br>rm: removes a file currently in the file system
<br>rn: renames an existing file
<br>touch: creates a file


# Instructions
1. Build in Visual Studio 
2. Run the Program in Command Prompt
